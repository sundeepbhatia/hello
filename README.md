# bio
A minimal bio of contributors. 

## sundeep
First real programming was using Fortran in 1984.
Started using C in 1987. First book was K&R and I still quite clearly remember the expression: `x & (x-1)`. So simple yet magical!
Wrote *nmake* in 1988. Worked on the C++ Compiler till 1999.
Professionally used C, C++, VB, Pascal, Java, JavaScript, perl, C#, Scala, node.js and a few others.
